What is it
----------

This project is a sample or a bootstrap [silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) application.
You can use it for your next php application.

### HTML / CSS / Javascripts are powered by:

* [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) with form integration. **version 2.2.2**

### Extensions included:

* Symfony/Console
* Assetics (with `assetic:dump` command)
* Doctrine (with `doctrine:database:create`, `doctrine:database:drop`,
  `doctrine:schema:load`, `doctrine:schema:show` commands)
* Form

Installation
------------

### With [composer](https://getcomposer.org)

Run the following commands:

    php composer.phar create-project -s dev lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition PATH/TO/YOUR/APP
    cd PATH/TO/YOUR/APP

### With git

Run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition.git PATH/TO/YOUR/APP
    cd PATH/TO/YOUR/APP
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

### Then

You can edit `resources/config/prod.php` and start hacking in `src/controllers.php`

### Assets management

Assets are generated for each request in debug mode.
Letting Assetic generate assets dynamically
in a production environment is not optimized.
Instead, each time you deploy your app in the production
environment, you should dump assets using `php console assetic:dump`.
