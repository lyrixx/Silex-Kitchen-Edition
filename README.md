Tests

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition)

Just run `phpunit`

Sometimes, you have to run : `chmod 777 -R cache/ web/assets`,
because CLI does not run with the same user as  [mod_php|php-fpm|.*].
